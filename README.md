# deno-experiments

This repository contains my experiments with using [deno](https://github.com/ry/deno), [Ryan Dahl](https://github.com/ry)'s runtime for TypeScript on v8 engine, with Go bindings.

It assumes that the `deno` executable is in your current path.

Execute the index file:

```
$ deno index.ts
```
